```{r setup, include=FALSE}

#data from PhD data sheet, not KAS sheet.
mydata  <- read.csv("https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vRBTqiIHQP1Pg3De1IGsJgVFiJla1dIHyHsGEsSmel8WVAeXXXHmSiyNnQAad9ATdzeukS43WE3PZ2m/pub?gid=0&single=true&output=csv")

```

I just wanted to make a plot for level of each site. 

```{r}
ggplot(mydata, aes(x = site_name, y = altitude.m._of_main_layer)) +
  geom_point() 
  
```
